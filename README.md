# 🚦 AURA : Automated User-Responsive Routing Assessment

AURA is a **smart traffic management system** that leverages **RFID technology** to optimize urban traffic flow. By integrating RFID tags on vehicles with RFID readers at intersections, AURA enables **real-time vehicle density monitoring** and **dynamic signal control**, reducing congestion, fuel wastage, and pollution.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 **Dynamic Traffic Signals** – Adjusts green light duration based on real-time traffic density.
- 📡 **RFID-Based Monitoring** – Reliable in all weather conditions (rain, fog, snow).
- 🚑 **Emergency Vehicle Support** – Automatically prioritizes ambulances and fire trucks.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
1. **RFID Tags** – Attached to vehicles for identification.  
2. **RFID Readers** – Installed at intersections to capture traffic flow.  
3. **Controller** – Calculates vehicle density and adjusts traffic signal timing.  
4. **Central System** – Stores traffic data for analysis and further integration.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – RFID readers detect passing vehicles.  
2. **Density Calculation** – Vehicle count per lane is calculated.  
3. **Signal Adjustment** – Traffic lights dynamically change according to density.  
4. **System Integration** – Ensures smooth coordination between signals.
